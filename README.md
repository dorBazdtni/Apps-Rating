# Predicting App Ratings in Google Play Store - Project
## <u>Introduction </u>
Welcome to the "Predicting App Ratings in Google Play Store" project! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning and data analysis techniques to predict the ratings of apps available on the Google Play Store. In this README, we will provide an overview of the project, its objectives, data sources, methodology, and usage instructions.

## <u>Project Overview</u>
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the rating of a mobile app on the Google Play Store based on various features and attributes associated with the app. Understanding what factors contribute to app ratings can be valuable for app developers, marketers, and users seeking high-quality apps.

## <u> Data Sources</u>
The project relies on publicly available data from the Google Play Store. The dataset used for this project includes information about various apps, such as their names, categories, sizes, version numbers, reviews, and, most importantly, user ratings.

## <u>Data Preprocessing </u>
Data Cleaning: We start by cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Feature Engineering: We extract relevant features from the raw data and create new variables if necessary. For example, we might create a feature to represent the number of reviews or the age of the app.

Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This includes visualizing data, identifying correlations, and understanding the distribution of ratings and other features.
Machine Learning
Feature Selection: We select the most important features for model training, which can include app category, size, number of installs, and more.

Model Selection: We experiment with different machine learning models, such as regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods, to find the best model for predicting app ratings.

Model Training: The selected model is trained using a portion of the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Model Evaluation: We assess the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to ensure it can generalize well to new data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model hyperparameters to optimize prediction accuracy.

## <u>Conclusion </u>
Predicting app ratings in the Google Play Store can provide valuable insights for app developers and users. This project showcases the process of cleaning, analyzing, and modeling data to build a predictive model. Feel free to explore and adapt this project to your own dataset and research goals.
